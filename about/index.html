         <p>Hello world! I'm sure by now you are already well familiar with my name so there's no reason to point it out again. The point of this page is to help you get to know me a little better. First off, I am a junior in High School that has always been most interested in the math and sciences. Since a really young age I knew I wanted my future to revolve around these subjects. While at school I am typically a quieter person until I am around my close friends or presenting a project to a class. On the field, I am both a midfielder and defense; typically, I am a strategic player. I'd consider myself a well-balanced student-athlete. At home, I spend my valuable free time on tinkering with my website, playing soccer or playing video games when neither are an option.</p>
         <p>Although I never realized it at the time, I was always interested in technology. I remember the time I received a 4th generation iPod Touch as a gift. The device fascinated me and eventually I had collected a series of devices over the years. One time, while playing basketball in my backyard, somehow, the ball knocked the iPod to the concrete and the screen shattered. Of course, being the broke kid anyone my age was, I took on the challenge to fix the screen myself. I did some research on the replacement of screens. I first went to YouTube thinking that it would be the easiest to visually follow along. Surprisingly, I was wrong. There weren’t many instructional videos on replacing the screen. Even with the videos I did find were too difficult to follow so I looked around at other pages until I eventually stitched together a guide. After ordering a cheap replacement LCD and digitizer, I began the process. Fun fact: this was the first time I ever used a hair dryer. It was also the first time I had stepped out of my comfort zone with technology. It sparked something inside of me.</p>
         <p>Feeling proud of the accomplishment I became attached to any iPod, iPhone or iPad I could get my hands on. More and more I learned how they worked and what can be done with them. Enter the world of jailbreaking. A user can jailbreak their device using exploited bugs in Apple’s software. Security researchers and iOS developers have joined together to form a community of jailbreakers. I began jailbreaking just a little after I received the iPod as a gift. I don’t exactly remember how I came across jailbreaking, but I do remember the first things I did with it. At the time I was really into a game called Zombie Café and while not a single person I knew played it, I was heavily invested into it. Some of the first things I remember doing with the jailbreak were installing custom themes, home screen animations, and Zombie Café hacks. I was a kid, and I just wanted to have fun. I did this for various other games all the way up to when I started 8th grade. I grew out of the simple parts to jailbreaking and moved onto dual booting. I continue to jailbreak my devices and actively support the community on Reddit to this day (If you see me on there make sure to say hey). Although jailbreaking broke a lot of restrictions put up by Apple, it was also where I learned a lot about Unix-based operating systems, gained a lot of general skills, and found an interest of mine.</p>
         <p>I found my true passion for computers around the age of 11 when my younger brother (two years younger) and I were tired of the limited functionality of the XBOX. We learned about the customizability that was only available to those who played on PC. I, more than my brother, grew attached to the idea of playing on PC. The limitlessness fascinated me. My brother, on the other hand, was reluctant to convert. Whether it was because he shied away from the seemingly complicated realm of computers or because he just wasn't as inclined to start the process, I don't know. I do know however, that I was excited to get a PC. Time passed and eventually, we both became convinced on making the switch. Fast forward a couple months: come the holidays my brother and I received low-end laptops as gifts. Since that day, I have become increasingly more and more entwined with the endless world of computers. A couple months later, after learning the basics of hardware, software and the Windows OS file system (directories), I left my brother behind for a bit. While he was enjoying his time as a kid playing custom Minecraft, I decided to build my own desktop computer. For months I planned out a list of compatible parts and by the end, put them together into the chassis. My father and I worked on building a desk to fit my room and setup perfectly; it was a dream for a kid like me. Over time, I enhanced my computer by adding not only stylish elements but also better peripherals. Soon enough, I moved on from Minecraft, going from game to game until I eventually wanted to learn more.</p>
         <p>I explored the many possibilities a computer has to offer, diving deeper into the barer bones of a computer: I became interested in the idea of programming. Initially, I began with small batch programs and games (some can even be found on my old YouTube channel). These were fun for a young kid like me because they were very easy to make and gave me a sense of accomplishment whenever I would see an idea become reality. I think it's what every programmer gets their 'spark' from; in essence it is a form of creativity. I loved and still love do. When batch became unsatisfying, I moved onto basic C++ applications for a short period of time, and then into Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). I started off making my websites in the program called Pingendo. If you aren't familiar, Pingendo is a bootstrap editor that will 'do the work for you'. At first it was exciting, but I didn't feel the same sense of accomplishment like I had with the previous languages; I wanted to feel as if I created it with my bare hands but Pingendo felt like riding a bike on training wheels. It was too easy. Not only that, but Pingendo was extremely limited. You were limited to the colors and objects the application offered. It just wasn’t for me. From then on, I began learning to code for myself. I would explain to you how I learned how to code but there just isn’t one direct answer. A list of the most impacting sites to me include Stack Overflow, Udemy, and YouTube. Taking courses on Udemy were the most beneficial to my fundamental understanding of HTML but websites and forums like Stack Overflow were the most helpful when I got stuck on an issue with my website. I got the basics down with HTML and at first, it bored me. To me, it was plain, and I wanted my site to look like the popular ones--with fancy text, buttons, and colors everywhere. This where my HTML world bridged across to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Picking it up was very simple and very fun! I could pick and choose what attributes and styles I want for what item on the screen. It was neat. At the time of writing this, I have been coding in mostly HTML and CSS for about three to four years and while I didn’t just learn the language magically, I didn’t learn it from one direct source. Clearly, I like web development as I am still doing it! I guess with this language, for once in my life, I was able to imagine something I create to be accessible by anyone in the world in a matter of seconds; something batch couldn't do (hence why I would post my programs on my YouTube). This was something that before, I always assumed was for big organizations or companies so picturing myself on the internet was exciting. I believe I have stuck mainly to these two languages simply because I am currently a student. HTML and CSS are very simple languages that are enjoyable to tinker with and all without consuming my life. I've built over 15 different websites in the past and I continue to create them. However, in the future, when this is my career, I definitely am going to learn new languages. Not just web development, but areas like app development (check out my GitHub, I made one app!) and software development. Currently, I am moving into jQuery and Python whenever I have the extra time (I hardly have time because of sports and rigorous classes).  All in all, programming in any language excites me and has really brought out a great part of my passion for technology.</p>
         <p>I am extremely passionate about all things computers. There are many points I missed in this summary but it is simply too hard to get into detail with every piece of my technological experiences; there are just too many to remember/tell. To wrap this all up, I'd like to say thank you to you for reading my story. I love it when people take interest in my interests equally. I hope you found this read at least somewhat enjoyable and I hope you have a good rest of your day or night!</p>
