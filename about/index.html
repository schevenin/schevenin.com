            <h5>Who am I?</h5>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">My name is Rogelio Schevenin Jr. and I am Mexican-American. My mother is a descendant of Scottish immigrants with a master’s degree. She is a bilingual educator and has always been a fierce advocate for English learners. She grew up in an affluent area, was able to afford college, and continues to pursue higher education. She knows how to successfully navigate life in the United States. My father grew up in Mexico. He barely completed high school and now works as a warehouse laborer.  As a child, I would hear stories of the struggles he had to endure. His parents were divorced, his mom was unemployed, and he was left to provide for his family while living in a single 800 square foot house. When my dad did not pass the entrance exam to his local public university at the age of 19, immigrating to the United States seemed like his best option. My upbringing has given me the tools to be successful and follow my dreams while inspiring me to be of service to my Hispanic community.

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">In order to maintain my heritage, my parents enrolled me in a K-12 dual immersion program, starting with a bilingual elementary school. This further cultivated my sense of pride for both of my cultural backgrounds.  I had Hispanic teachers for role models and learned to fluently speak, read, and write in both English and Spanish. Moreover, it fostered my ability to see the world from different perspectives. Because of this, I developed a strong sense of empathy and desire to help others. In high school, I chose to be a peer tutor in mathematics.  Here, my knowledge of math and my ability to connect with others allowed me to effectively teach younger students. I found it rewarding to help others overcome their struggles in math. Additionally, I worked at my local youth summer camp. My duties included leading the students in camp activities, but I often had to help children resolve disputes. Being a role model for these predominantly Hispanic children gave me a sense of purpose similar to my experience as a peer tutor.

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">My passion for Computer Science began with my first laptop which I used to play Minecraft. I built my own computer at 13 and would spend hours fervently honing my computer skills. My first Computer Science class was during my sophomore year and I have since taken 3 more courses at the community college. It was only natural that I use my computer skills to help our high school soccer team’s booster club build a website to engage the local community. The majority of our soccer team was Hispanic and many were from low socioeconomic backgrounds. We didn’t have the funds to pay for nets, soccer balls, or practice jerseys. In fact, when I first joined the team, our uniforms were 10 years old. I was excited to take on this programming project. Using my knowledge of the programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I put together a website. Now, our website allows fans to buy school apparel, stay updated on events, and purchase tickets to our yearly Soccer Fiesta Fundraiser. With the help of the website, our team has been able to partner with local residents and businesses. This year, our 4th Annual Soccer Fiesta fundraiser had the largest turnout yet.  Local companies like Nugget Markets, Osaka Sushi Japanese Restaurant, and Master Tech Auto Shop sponsored our team. I channeled my passion for Computer Science into a project that benefits my community.

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">As a senior in high school, I am about to begin my college journey. I have committed to the Honors College at San Diego State University for Computer Science. My ultimate goal is to complete a doctorate and become a university professor of Computer Science. Hispanic Computer Science professors are a minority in U.S. universities. I aspire to become a role model for Hispanic scholars. This way, I can explore my passion through research while fulfilling my desire to help others. Furthermore, I realize there is a need to inspire Hispanic youth to pursue STEM careers early in their education.  For this reason, my dream is to establish a program to bring STEM to Hispanic students in public schools. Such a program would offer hands on experience and project-based experimental learning curriculum. From a young age, students would be inspired and empowered to explore interests in the STEM field. My hope is that I could give students the opportunity to go to college that my dad never had.
