             <p>Hello world! My full name is Rogelio Schevenin Jr. and the point of this page is to help you get to know me a little better. I am a senior in High School and I love to learn. Of course, like every high school student, I have favorite subjects. For me, these have always been my math and science classes. While at school, I am typically a quieter person until I am around my close friends; however, I will speak up when I need to. On the field, I am both a strategic midfielder and defender. I am also more expressive playing soccer than I am at school, but I think that is necessary in any team game. At home, I spend my valuable free time tinkering with my technology, spending time with my family or playing video games with my brother. Overall, I'd consider myself a well-balanced student-athlete.</p>
            <p>Wherever I go, I am constantly asked by people that I know, “How did you learn to do this?”. This usually results in the automatic reply “I don’t know, over time I guess?”. The truth is I really don’t know exactly how I got to where I am. It really started when my brother considered buying a laptop to play Minecraft on the PC, as opposed to the XBOX, because horses were included. Yes, that idea my brother had on a random night home from soccer practice was the spark to the flame. The intricacy of the technological industry kept the flame growing and eventually, that idea led to getting a laptop, building a computer, learning to code, starting a server, experience in penetration testing, numerous school projects, freelancing jobs, creating Arduino projects with one of my best friends, developing my own website, publishing an app, and so much more. So this brings me back to the question. The real answer is that I learned how to do these things the same way anyone else could; I tinkered with it, failed, and succeeded. The challenge isn’t finding out how. Instead, real challenge is persisting and staying interested even in times of failure. Learning is a part of who I am; learning about the science of computers is something I will never have enough of.</p>
            <p>If my brother hadn’t brought that idea to my attention, it’s likely you wouldn’t be reading this. Every great invention, business, or passion in history began with an idea. Something to take away from this is that no matter how seemingly insignificant of an idea you think you have, you should try it out. You miss all the chances you don’t take.</p>
            <p>Thank you to you for reading my story. I hope you have learned a little about me, have a good rest of your day or night!</p>
