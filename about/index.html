            <p>Hello world! My full name is Rogelio Schevenin Jr. and the point of this page is to help you get to know me a little better. I am a senior in High School and I love to learn. I've been asked many times, “How did you learn to do this?”. This usually results in an automatic response along the lines of “I don’t know, over time I guess?”.<br><br>The truth is I really don’t know exactly how it all happened. It started when my brother considered buying a laptop to play Minecraft on the PC, as opposed to the XBOX, because horses were included. Yes, horses. We got laptops and everything began to snowball. The intricacy of the technological industry kept me interested and eventually led to building a computer, learning to code, starting a minecraft server, numerous school projects, Arduino projects, developing my own website, publishing an app, and working on projects with someone I now call my best friend. The real answer is that I learned how to do these things the same way anyone else does; it interested me, I tried things out, failed, kept trying and eventually succeeded. I enjoyed it and when you really enjoy something, you just call your failures version 1. Learning is a part of who I am, and learning about the science of computers is something I will never have enough of.<br><br>What blows my mind is that if I didn't want to play with horses in Minecraft, it’s likely you wouldn’t be reading this. Every great invention, business, or passion in history began with an idea. You miss all the chances you don’t take, so take them!<br><br>Thank you to you for reading. I hope you have a good rest of your day or night!</p>
