     <p class="description white">Hello people of the internet! I'm sure by now you are already well familiar with my name so theres no need to point it out again. Anyways, I hope this page helps you get to know me a little better. I am a junior in High School that has always been most interested in the maths and sciences. It is also pretty safe to say I'm extremely passionate about all things computers. I found my passion for computers and technology around the age of 11 or 12 when my younger brother (two years younger) and I were tired of the limited functionality of the XBOX version of Minecraft. We learned about mods and texture packs that were only availiable to those who played on PC. I, more than my brother, grew attached to the idea of playing on PC and could see it happening. My brother, on the other hand, was reluctant to convert. Whether it was because he shied away from the seemingly complicated realm of computers or because he just wasn't as inclined to start the process, I don't know. I do know however, that I was and for the most part, this eased my brother's shyness. Eventually, we both became convinced on making the switch. Fast forward a couple months: come the next Christmas my brother and I recieved laptops as gifts. Since that day in 2013, I have become increasingly more and more entwined with the endless world of computers. A couple months later, after learning the basics of hardware, software and the Windows OS file system (directories), I left my brother behind for a bit. While he was enjoying his time as a kid playing custom Minecraft, I decided to build my own desktop computer. For months I planned out a list of compatible parts and by the end, put them together into the chasse. My father and I worked on building a desk to fit my room and setup perfectly; it was a dream for a kid like me. Over time, I enhanced my computer by adding not only stylish elements but also better peripherals. Soon enough, I moved on from Minecraft, going from game to game until I eventually wanted to learn more. I explored the many possibilities a computer has to offer, diving deeper into the more bare bones of a computer: I became interested in the idea of programming. Initially, I began with small batch programs and games (some can even be found on my really old youtube channel). These were fun for a young kid like me because they were very easy to make and gave me a sense of accomplishment whenever I would see an idea become reality. I think it's what every programmer gets their 'spark' from; in essence it is a form of creativity. I loved and still love it. When batch became too generic and unsatisfying, I moved onto small time C++ appications for a short period of time, and then into Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). I started off making my websites in the program called Pingendo. If you aren't familiar, it is a bootstrap editor that will 'do the work for you'. At first it was exciting but I didn't feel the same sense of accomplishment like I had with the previous languages; I wanted to feel as if I created it with my bare hands. From then, I began writing my code myself. I guess with this language, for once in my life, I was able to imagine something I create to be accessible by anyone in the world via the internet; something batch couldn't do (hence why I would post my programs on my YouTube). This was something that before, I always assumed was for big organizations or companies so picturing myself on the internet was exciting. I got the basics down with HTML and at first, it actually sort of bored me. To me, it was really plain and I wanted my site to look like the popular ones--with fancy text, buttons, and colors everywhere. This where my HTML world bridged accross to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Picking it up was very simple and pretty satisfying! I could pick and choose what attributes and styles I want for what item on the screen. It was pretty neat. I got a good understanding of these two languages with the help of Stacks Exchange, Udemy Courses, and various forums. This was definitely where I spent most my time learning and mostly because I was and still am a student. HTML and CSS are very simple languages that are enjoying to tinker with and all without consuming my life. I've built over 15 different websites in the past and I still continue to create them. I'm now moving into PHP, jQuery and Python whenever I have the extra time (I hardly have time because of sports and rigorous classes). There are points I definitly missed in this summary but it is simply too hard to get into detail with every piece of my technological experiences; there's just too many to remember/tell. To wrap this all up, I'd like to say thank you to you for reading my story. I love it when people take interest in my interests equally :) I hope you found this read at least somewhat enjoyable and I hope you have a good rest of your day/night! ~Rogelio S.</p>
