							<h2>Timeline</h2>
							<p>Throughout the period of the Cold War there were many important events. Here, I have compiled a list of ten of the most important events and their dates.</p>

									<h3>1948 Berlin Airlift</h3>
									<p>The U.S. and Britain announced a proposal for establishing a new currency, the Deutschmark, into West Berlin. The Soviets responded on June 24 by cutting off all road, rail and canal links between West Germany and West Berlin. This was the start of the Berlin Blockade.  Stalin was attempting to get western influence out of his West Berlin.  He managed to cut off all of the land and water routes however the air was still available.  This began the Berlin Air Lift where the U.S. and British planes supplied West Berlin with 1.5 million tons of supplies, a plane landing every three minutes, day and night.</p>

									<h3>1950 Korean War</h3>
									<p>After the end of WWII, Korea was divided by the U.S. to the south and Russia/China to the North similar to what happened in Germany. On June 25, 1950, the North invaded the south pushing all the way to the tip of the peninsula in a matter of months.  The U.S. soon intervened by landing in Incheon, not too far south of the 38th parallel.  With the help of the U.S., the South pushed back up to the Chinese border.  The Chinese then fought back and pushed back down to the 38th parallel.  The rest of the war was fought along this line where an armistice was signed in 1953. This war is one of the most important even though it is often forgotten.  This is where the U.S. wins its first battle of containment against the Soviet Union.</p>

									<h3>1955 Vietnam War</h3>
									<p>The French could no longer control Vietnam so Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam decided to form a communist country. When it became obvious the Chinese were assisting Ho, the government of the south asked the Allied countries for assistance. The allies agreed because they wanted to get rid of all communism. However, because the U.S. was fighting against the communist North Vietnamese, the Soviets decided to back up the communists. The fighting escalated until in 1968 there were about 550,000 Allied troops there assisting the south. In 1968 the Viet Cong assassinated about 3,000 civilians during the Tet offensive which was supposed to be a cease fire.  The communists ignored their promise and attacked numerous cities in the south.  Eventually, the cost and the death toll turned Americans totally against the war and on April 30, 1975 the last American troops left Vietnam by helicopter as the soldiers of the communist soldiers of the north marched into Saigon.</p>

									<h3>1957 Sputnik Crisis</h3>
									<p>The Sputnik crisis was the American reaction to the success of the Sputnik program.  It was a key Cold War event that began on October 4, 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite. Although Sputnik was itself harmless, its orbiting intensified the continual threat the United States watched for from the Soviet Union The same rocket that launched Sputnik could send a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, crossing the oceans that had successfully protected the continental United States from attack during both World Wars. This event was an important time period in the cold war because it sent Americans into a stage of panic.  People started to think that the Soviets were more technologically advanced than us.  This worried most people because technology is everything when it comes to nuclear warfare.  It made Americans focus on advancement and achievement.</p>

									<h3>1960 U-2 Incident</h3>
									<p>The Soviet Union shot down a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance plane and called the flight an aggressive act. The U.S. denied Soviet claims that the pilot, F. Gary Powers, had stated that his mission was to collect Soviet intelligence data.  Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at this time, declared that the Soviet Union would not take part in a scheduled summit conference with the U.S., Britain, and France unless the U.S. immediately stopped flights over Soviet territory, apologized, and punished those responsible. Powers was tried in the Soviet Union and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In 1962 he was exchanged for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel.</p>

									<h3>1962 Cuban Missile Crisis</h3>
									<p>A U-2 spy plane flying over Cuba discovered nuclear missile sites under construction. President Kennedy convened a small group of senior officials to debate the crisis. Kennedy ordered a naval blockade of Cuba and all U.S. military forces to DEFCON 3. ICBMs were prepared for launch, Polaris submarines were dispatched, and B-52 bombers were placed on alert.  The world watched as tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union increased. Later, U.S. forces were placed on DEFCON 2 which was the next step towards a nuclear war. Finally on October 28, Khrushchev announced that they were withdrawing the missiles from Cuba. In the spring of 1963, the U.S. quietly removed the missiles from Turkey that equally threatened the Soviet Union. This crisis is regarded as the closest the world has come to a nuclear exchange.</p>

									<h3>1968 Proliferation Treaty</h3>
									<p>The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. A total of 190 parties have joined the Treaty, with five states being recognized as nuclear-weapon states: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China (also the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council). The NPT was very important during the Cold War because both the U.S. and the Soviets agreed to not use nuclear weapons.</p>

									<h3>1979 Soviet Afghan War</h3>
									<p>It was fought between Soviet-led Afghan forces against multi-national rebel groups called the mujahideens.  The Soviets led the Afghans because they were communist and had good resources.  The rebels were backed by the U.S. to combat the Soviets without having to declare war on them.  The rebels received military training in neighboring Pakistan, China, and received billions of dollars from the U.S., United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Afghan civilians were killed in addition to the participants in the war.  The initial Soviet deployment of the 40th Army in Afghanistan began on December 24, 1979 under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.  The final troop withdrawal started on May 15, 1988, and ended on February 15, 1989 under the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.  This like the Vietnam war is another example of a proxy war.</p>

									<h3>1985 Perestroika &amp; Glasnost</h3>
									<p>When Mikhail S. Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985, he launched his nation on a dramatic new course.  His dual program of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness) introduced huge changes in economic practice, internal affairs and international relations.  Within five years, Gorbachev's revolutionary program swept communist governments throughout Eastern Europe from power and brought an end to the Cold War (1945-91).  The largely political and economic rivalry between the Soviets and the United States and their respective allies that emerged following World War II was over. These policies were great for the U.S. because they ended the Cold War that had weighed on our shoulders for almost 50 years.  These ideas changed the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe forever.</p>

									<h3>1989 Berlin Wall Falls</h3>
									<p>In the late 1980s Russian leader Gorbachev decided to abandon Russia’s satellite states to try and save his crumbling nation, allowing democracy to filter through, as it did in Poland.  There were anti-government protests in East Germany and, after some initially stern words by East German leader Honecker which threatened violence, Russia refused to back him and he resigned. The new leader, Egon Krenz, decided against violence and instead ordered a relaxation of travel restrictions to the West in order to try and defuse rising tensions. Schabowski briefed the media on November 9, 1989 on the swiftly written decree he misinterpreted what it said, announcing that East Germans could freely use all border crossings to "permanently exit" the nation.  Word soon spread and people gathered at the border crossings. Although the guards had no orders to do so, they reopened the borders with the rest of Germany, allowing people to cross freely. The wall ceased to function from that day forward, and people were soon chipping away at it, eventually knocking it down. The falling of the wall symbolized the end of the cold war and the end of the Iron Curtains dominance. This was important to the Cold War because it signaled the end.</p>

											<h2>Full Metal Jacket: Movie Review</h2>
											<span>Even though the movie film is specifically about the Vietnam War, it can be easily translated into daily life where the true ugly realities of war are displayed. While very graphic, the movie Full Metal Jacket does a great job at showing the harsh reality of war. It helps the viewer fully grasp what the times of tension such as the Cold War were like.</span>
